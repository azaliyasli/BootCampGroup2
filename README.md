# ðŸ•™ Sprint 1

## ðŸ“’ Sprint Notes:

âš¡ `Notion` application was used for task tracking.

âš¡ `Miro` application was used for the idea development phase.

âš¡ It has been decided to use `Firebase` for the backend and it was decided to use email and Google login for the login system.

âš¡ It has been determined that a chatbot will be used, and for this, `Gemini` will be utilized.

## ðŸ’¯ Expected Point Completion within Sprint:

### ðŸ§  Point Completion Logic:

- During this sprint, due to the holiday, we focused more on the idea development phase, visual design of the product, and the basic features of our application, and we also took some steps towards the coding part of our product. We allocated **100** points for the idea development phase and completed all of it. We allocated **200** points for the visual design of our application and we completed all of it. We allocated **250** points for coding but only completed **80** points of it. By the end of Sprint 1, we completed a total of **380** points.

## ðŸ’¬ Sprint Review:

âš¡ First, as a team, we decided on an idea and gave our application a name.

âš¡ Ali compiled all the user stories for our application.

âš¡ Ahmet provided a login or sign-up page for our application with Firebase to allow our users to log in. He also participated in the coding part for the Gemini integration and researched stock market APIs with AslÄ±.

âš¡ Ali Cihan and AslÄ± also participated in the coding part for the Gemini integration.

âš¡ Yavuz designed our logo and the general design of our application. In addition, he visualized those user stories.

âš¡ During this sprint, we faced difficulties in the API research part and data retrieval. We also encountered a few issues with the Gemini integration. However, during this process, we learned the most about the field of artificial intelligence.

## ðŸŒ± Sprint Retrospective:

- In the second sprint, we plan to focus more on the coding area and aim to complete the `UX/UI design` and implement it into the code. Additionally, we will find a `stock market API` and complete the integration of `Gemini`.

## ðŸ‘¾ What We Learnt In This Sprint:

ðŸš© We learned how to fetch data via API in JSON format and add the packages we obtained from multiple pages to the main file.

ðŸš© We learned that we need to use Generative AI for integration with Gemini.

ðŸš© We learned how to perform user registration and login operations with Firebase. Users can log into the application with their email addresses and Google accounts. For users trying to log in with their email accounts, a verification link is sent to their registered email addresses. When users forget their passwords, they can set a new password using the "forgot my password" option sent to their registered email address.

ðŸš© We discovered APIs and solution methods for the news summaries we plan to add to our application using open-source AI-powered scraping sites. We realized that most of these packages are in Python and that we need to work on obtaining the desired data structures through prompt engineering
